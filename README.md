# Sentinel-Image-processing-using-GEE

Change detection using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-2 imagery involves analyzing multi-temporal satellite data to identify and quantify changes that occur in land cover, vegetation, urban development, or other environmental factors over time. Leveraging the vast archive of Sentinel-2 imagery available on GEE, this process typically involves several key steps:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Accessing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from GEE, spanning various time periods, capturing spectral information across different wavelengths.

2. **Pre-processing:** Preparing and pre-processing the imagery, including calibration, cloud masking, and geometric corrections to ensure data quality and consistency.

3. **Image Stacking:** Stacking or mosaicking multiple images from different time points to create a composite image stack, allowing for direct comparison of pixel values across time.

4. **Change Detection Algorithms:** Applying change detection algorithms, such as image differencing, spectral indices, or machine learning techniques, to analyze the differences between image pairs and detect changes in land cover, vegetation health, or other features.

5. **Visualization and Analysis:** Visualizing the detected changes through classification maps, difference images, or thematic layers to identify and interpret areas of change.

6. **Validation and Interpretation:** Validating detected changes through ground truthing or reference data and interpreting the results to understand the nature and implications of the observed changes.

Change detection using GEE and Sentinel-2 imagery offers valuable insights into land use dynamics, environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and urban development tracking. The scalability and computational power of GEE combined with the high spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery make it a powerful tool for monitoring and understanding changes in the Earth's surface over time.
